An LED is a type of diode that makes one color of light when electricity is sent through it in the expected direction (electrically biased in the forward direction). This effect is a kind of electroluminescence.

The color of the light depends on the chemical composition of the semiconducting material used, and can be near-ultraviolet, visible or infrared.[3] The color affects how much electricity is used by the LED. A white LED has three LEDs inside, of three different colors.

LEDs are used in many places. They are the colored indicator lights on many electronic devices, they can be used to make bright advertising signs, brake lights on a car, and more recently, light bulbs for the home. White LEDs bright enough to illuminate rooms are usually more expensive than regular lightbulbs but they last longer and burn less electricity.

LEDs, which make their own light, should not be confused with LCDs, which block light.

Todays leds can also base on surface-mount technology and may be very small.
